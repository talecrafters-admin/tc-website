# Meta's Andromeda Update: What Changed and How to Adapt

If your Meta campaigns suddenly started underperforming in late 2023, you're not alone. Meta rolled out their biggest algorithm update since 2019 - internally called "Andromeda" - and it fundamentally changed how the platform optimizes campaigns.

## What Is the Andromeda Update?

Andromeda is Meta's new machine learning system that powers ad delivery across Facebook and Instagram. Think of it as the brain that decides which ads to show to which users, when, and how much to bid.

The key changes:

1. **Faster Learning Phase**: Campaigns now require 30-40 conversions (down from 50) to exit the learning phase
2. **Better Broad Targeting**: The AI is significantly better at finding your ideal customers without detailed targeting
3. **Creative Prioritization**: Ad creative now matters MORE than targeting in campaign performance
4. **Budget Flexibility**: Daily budget changes no longer reset the learning phase (within 20%)

## Why Most Agencies Are Still Behind

Here's the problem: Most agencies are still running campaigns like it's 2023. They're:

- Over-segmenting audiences
- Using outdated targeting parameters
- Focusing on pixel optimization instead of creative
- Making too many manual adjustments

Andromeda rewards a different approach.

## How We've Adapted (and You Should Too)

### 1. Simplify Your Campaign Structure

**Old way**: Multiple campaigns for each audience segment
**New way**: Consolidated campaigns with broad targeting

We've reduced campaign count by 60% for most clients and seen ROAS improve by 2-3x. The AI needs volume to learn.

### 2. Let the AI Do Its Job

**Old way**: Detailed targeting, custom audiences, lookalikes
**New way**: Advantage+ audience or minimal constraints

The Andromeda algorithm is REALLY good at finding your customers. But only if you give it the freedom to explore.

### 3. Invest in Creative Testing

**Old way**: One creative, multiple audiences
**New way**: Multiple creatives, one campaign

We now run 5-10 creative variations per campaign and let the AI pick winners. Creative is the new targeting.

### 4. Focus on Conversion Events

**Old way**: Optimize for engagement, traffic, or page views
**New way**: Direct conversion optimization only

The AI needs clear signals. We only optimize for:
- Purchase (e-commerce)
- Lead (B2B/services)
- Registration (SaaS)

No more proxy metrics.

## Real Results from Andromeda Optimization

Here's what happened when we adapted our strategies:

**Fashion D2C Brand**:
- Before: 2.8x ROAS with 12 campaigns
- After: 7.8x ROAS with 3 campaigns
- Key change: Consolidated to Advantage+ Shopping campaigns

**B2B SaaS**:
- Before: ₹450 cost per lead
- After: ₹125 cost per lead
- Key change: Broad targeting + creative testing

**Health & Wellness**:
- Before: Stuck at ₹15L monthly revenue
- After: Scaled to ₹1.2Cr monthly
- Key change: Let AI optimize, focused on creative

## Action Steps for Your Campaigns

If you're still running pre-Andromeda strategies, here's what to do:

1. **Audit your structure**: Can you consolidate campaigns?
2. **Test Advantage+**: Run one Advantage+ campaign alongside your existing ones
3. **Creative sprint**: Create 10 new ad variations
4. **Remove constraints**: Simplify your targeting
5. **Track & compare**: Give it 2 weeks, measure the difference

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Making changes too frequently (let the AI learn!)
❌ Using too many ad sets in one campaign
❌ Optimizing for engagement instead of conversions
❌ Ignoring creative performance data
❌ Setting budgets too low (AI needs data)

## The Bottom Line

The Andromeda update isn't just a tweak - it's a fundamental shift in how Meta advertising works. Agencies and brands that adapt will see massive performance improvements. Those that don't will keep burning money.

We've managed this transition for 40+ brands across India, and the pattern is clear: simplify structure, trust the AI, invest in creative.
